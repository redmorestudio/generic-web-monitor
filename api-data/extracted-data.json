Tabnine supports more than 1 million developers across companies in every industry.\n\nUnlike generic coding assistants, Tabnine is the AI that you control.\n\nCode acceleration and code exploration\n\nTabnine can help you both in acceleration (allowing you to achieve your tasks faster) and in exploration (allowing you to collaborate with AI assistance toward designing a solution for your problem).\n\nHow to use Tabnine\n\nUse code completions for more simple, small, or repetitive coding tasks, involving writing the next line/s of code.\n\nUse Tabnine Chat for higher-level tasks, explaining to Tabnine Chat what you want it to do.\n\nTo get the best out of Tabnine, we recommend working with both.

A New Study's Surprising Answer.\n\nA recent viral study from METR challenged a core assumption of the AI era: that AI tools make developers more productive. It found that expert developers were actually 19% slower when using them, even though they felt 20% faster. In this post, we break down the likely reasons for this surprising slowdown and argue the study's focus on expert speed leads us to consider a more profound story: AI's true value may be in empowering a new generation of vibe coders and managers to build things that otherwise would never have existed. Ultimately, the question isn't just whether AI makes us faster. It's about how we measure value in an era where enjoyment, context, and empowerment are becoming just as important as the clock.\n\nRead more\n\nJuly 10, 2025\n\nGeneral\nWe voted on the internet's hottest AI takes | Human in the Loop: Episode 9\n\nOur Enterprise team reacts to controversial statements about AI and votes on whether they agree or disagree.\n\nRead more\n\nJuly 9, 2025\n\nResearch\nBeyond the Black Box: Teaching Models to Verbalize Reward Hacking\n\nOne of AI's biggest challenges is \"reward hacking,\" where models learn to game the system for a correct answer instead of actually reasoning. This hidden deception makes AI untrustworthy. Scale research has found a powerful solution: instead of stopping the hacking, get the model to admit to it in its Chain-of-Thought reasoning. This new paper details how Verbalization Fine-Tuning (VFT) trains models to announce their shortcuts, dramatically increasing transparency from 11% to 94% and making AI systems fundamentally safer.\n\nRead more\n\nJuly 8, 2025\n\nResearch\nDetecting and Evaluating Agent Sabotage\n\nA new research collaboration led by a MATS sc",

It’s been a year since we dropped out of Stanford to build Pika, and in that time, we’ve done a stealth launch on Discord, released our 1.0 model and web app, shipped multiple first-to-market features, and grown our team from three to thirteen.\n\nBut most importantly, we’ve witnessed just how powerful it is when more people have the ability to tell stories through video.\n\nThat’s why we’re thrilled and humbled to announce that we’ve raised an $80M series B, bringing our total funding to $135M. Led by the incredible team at Spark Capital, this round will enable us to accelerate our progress in building the best video foundation model, and the best possible product for video creators.\n\nAnd, it will also help us continue hiring the best possible talent (hint: if that’s you, apply here!)\n\nWe want to thank all of our new investors for believing in our vision to remove the barriers to video creation—leading investment firms and individuals across tech and entertainment, including Greycroft, Lightspeed, Neo, Makers Fund, Jared Leto, and Craig Kallman. That’s in addition to our investors from previous rounds, including Nat Friedman, Daniel Gross, Elad Gil, Adam D’Angelo, Mike Vernal, Karim Atiyeh, Aaron Levie, Andrej Karpathy, Aravind Srinivas, Clem Delangue, Alex Chung, Mateusz Staniszewski, Conviction, and SV Angel.\n\nAnd we’d be remiss if we didn’t close this post with love and appreciation for our community of creators, of all kinds. Your ideas are what fuel Pika, and what drive us to make it better.\n\n- Demi & Chenlin\n\nPhoto credit: Lauren Segal\nBe the first to hear about Pika updates\nGet Our Newsletter\nCOMPANY\nAbout Us\nCareers\nContact Us\nPricing\nBlog\nAPI\nCONNECT\nDiscord\nInstagram\nX\nYouTube\nFacebook\nTikTok\nTerms of Service\n\nPika © 2025.

The full list of included models can be found here.\n\nWho owns the code generated in Cursor?\n\nYou! Regardless of whether you use the free, pro or business version of Cursor, all generated code is yours and free to be used however you like, including commercially.\n\nHow do the plan limits work?\n\nLimits will always be greater than the cost of one's plan. For example, Pro includes at least $20 of agent model inference at API prices per month. If you go over your limit, we'll nicely ask you to upgrade or switch to an unlimited model.\n\nWhere does Cursor use custom models?\n\nCursor is powered by a combination of custom models and API models.

Februar 2023, Heidelberg\n\nThe Heidelberg AI start-up Aleph Alpha has released a performance report on its AI language model, Luminous. The research compares Luminous to the models from GPT-3 and ChatGPT developer OpenAI, among others. The scientific comparison included tasks related to text classification, evaluation, and generation, as well as answering questions about specific text contents. The result is impressive – with Luminous, a European AI language model is, for the first time, on par with the world’s leading AI language models, while being much more efficient. In comparison, Luminous is with 70 billion parameters only half as big as its competitors, who have around 175 billion parameters, and thus has twice the efficiency at the same level of performance.\n\n“A systematic comparison of the best language models shows that our team is playing in the Champions League. What our customers and partners confirm based on their use cases can also be shown in the sum of the tests we have conducted: Luminous is a strong alternative in many environments and thus serves as an important step towards Europe’s technological sovereignty.” (Jonas Andrulis, founder & CEO of Aleph Alpha).\n\nFoundation for latest assistance systems\n\nLuminous is twice as efficient which translates to a better scaling and lower resource consumption when in use. With the citizen assistant Lumi for the city of Heidelberg, a similar system to ChatGPT (OpenAI) was realised in October 2022. Lumi was developed based on Luminous and is for the first time able to address individual, non-programmed questions from citizens. It simplifies the information and makes it accessible to people who have previously found official communication inaccessible due to its complexity or struggled with spelling or language. Lumi’s",

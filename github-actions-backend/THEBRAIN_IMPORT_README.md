- **People**: Key industry leaders and executives
- **Markets**: Enterprise AI, Developer Tools, Healthcare, etc.
- **Pricing**: Various pricing tiers and models
- **Capabilities**: Core competencies and strategic capabilities

### Relationships (743 total)
- Company → owns → Product
- Product → features → Feature
- Company → implements → Technology
- Company → partners with → Company
- Company → targets → Market
- And many more relationship types

## Import Scripts Created

1. **test_brain_import.py** - Test import of 10 thoughts
2. **import_complete_to_brain.py** - Full import of all data
3. **check_brain_import_status.py** - Check current import status
4. **run_brain_import.sh** - Easy run script

## How to Import

### Step 1: Test Import (Recommended)
First, test with a small batch to ensure everything works:

```bash
cd /Users/sethredmore/ai-monitor-fresh/github-actions-backend
python3 test_brain_import.py
```

This will import 10 thoughts. Check TheBrain to verify they appear correctly.

### Step 2: Full Import
Once the test is successful, run the complete import:

```bash
./run_brain_import.sh
```

Or directly:
```bash
python3 import_complete_to_brain.py
```

## What the Import Does

1. **Creates all thoughts** with appropriate:
   - Names (from your competitive data)
   - Types (Normal thoughts or Tags for markets)
   - Colors (different colors for companies, products, features, etc.)

2. **Creates all links** with:
   - Proper relationships (jump links mostly)
   - Descriptive link names (owns, features, implements, etc.)

3. **Adds all notes** with:
   - Full markdown content
   - Entity descriptions
   - Keywords and metadata

## Import Features

- **Incremental**: Won't re-import already mapped thoughts
- **Safe**: Saves progress after each thought
- **Colored**: Different entity types get different colors
- **Comprehensive**: Imports thoughts, links, AND notes

## After Import

Once complete, you'll have a fully connected knowledge graph in TheBrain showing:
- How AI companies relate to each other
- Product features and capabilities
- Technology implementations
- Market segmentation
- Partnership networks
- Competitive landscape

## Monitoring Progress

The import will show progress like:
```
[1] Creating thought: OpenAI (company)
[2] Creating thought: Claude (product)
...
Progress: 100 thoughts created
```

## Time Estimate

With 720 thoughts + 743 links + 720 notes, expect the full import to take approximately 30-45 minutes due to API rate limiting.

## Troubleshooting

If the import stops:
1. Check the id_mapping_current.json file - it saves progress
2. Re-run the import - it will skip already imported items
3. Check your Brain API key is still valid

## Current Brain Stats
- Brain Name: Competitive-monitor
- Current Thoughts: 65
- Current Links: 22
- After Import: ~785 thoughts, ~765 links

open questions
 how do we maintain state of the system over time - who is responsible, what happens when someone launches a new, important product line, how can we automatically take this into account 

 also how do we communicate the state of the world - like charts and graphs for what is happening right now?  Also, what sort of trends do we think about, if at all

 do we need to have a hierarchy of competitors (yes) - 3 tiers

 need to have some way to handle alerts that takes into account the importance of the announcement and the importance of the competitor as like a multiplicative thing
    can we set this up like a gartner magic quadrant thingie
    we do the size, they do the relevance (or something) - basically we will show them the company name, a one liner, link to the site, and then the person has choose something that says how relevant/important/interesting this company is

  we do need to figure out how we map all the products across the competition
